# Generalized Impulse Response Function (GIRF) Analysis

## Comparative Analysis of GIRF Patterns

The Generalized Impulse Response Functions reveal fundamental differences in transmission dynamics across the three model specifications:

### NVAR(1,1) Characteristics
The GIRF for NVAR(1,1) shows immediate, strong responses that decay rapidly. The initial impact at h=1 is particularly pronounced (e.g., 0.805 for [A]₁₃), reflecting direct network effects. Responses follow a clear geometric decay pattern, with higher-order connections (A², A³, etc.) emerging sequentially at each horizon. This pattern indicates a simple transmission mechanism where innovations propagate exactly one network link per observation period.

### NVAR(p,1) Dynamics
The NVAR(p,1) model demonstrates more complex behavior due to multiple lags:
1. Initial responses are dampened (0.486 vs 0.805 for [A]₁₃) as the impact is distributed across lags
2. Non-monotonic patterns emerge, particularly visible at h=3 where some coefficients show reversal effects
3. Longer memory is evident, with significant responses persisting through h=10
4. The presence of both positive and negative coefficients in the response paths suggests self-correcting mechanisms

### NVAR(p,q) Temporal Aggregation Effects
The frequency mismatch (q > 1) introduces additional complexity:

**Compression Effect**: Multiple network interactions occur within single observation periods, creating:
- Earlier appearance of higher-order connections
- Smoother response profiles with less pronounced peaks
- More persistent effects across horizons

**Phase Mixing**: The aggregation of network interactions leads to:
- Blurring of distinct transmission waves
- Combined effects of multiple lags appearing simultaneously
- Complex cross-horizon interactions that aren't separable in the observed data

## Key Comparative Insights

1. **Response Magnitude**:
   - NVAR(1,1): Strong initial impact, fast decay
   - NVAR(p,1): Moderate initial impact, complex evolution
   - NVAR(p,q): Smoothed impact, prolonged duration

2. **Transmission Timing**:
   - Pure network effects are most clearly identifiable in NVAR(1,1)
   - NVAR(p,1) reveals lagged adjustment processes
   - NVAR(p,q) shows blended temporal effects

3. **Empirical Implications**:
   - NVAR(1,1) may overestimate short-term network effects
   - NVAR(p,1) captures richer dynamic adjustments
   - NVAR(p,q) is essential when observation frequency differs from network interaction frequency

The results demonstrate that model misspecification can substantially alter inferred network dynamics, particularly regarding:
- The speed of shock propagation
- The persistence of network effects
- The apparent importance of direct versus indirect connections
